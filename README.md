# ParticleFiringExplosion
This personal project is a GUI application which displays particles being fired from the center of the window outwards, 
while changing color and direction. It is written in C++ and uses SDL2 library(https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) 
to render the particles on the screen.

How to run
----------
Go to bin\Release and open the application ParticleFiring.exe.

Why
---
I created this project to explore concepts of C++ and object orientation.
